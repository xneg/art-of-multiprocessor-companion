# art-of-multiprocessor-companion
This repository contains code that reflects my studies while reading the book "Art of Multiprocessor Programming".

At the moment solution consists of four projects:

* __Locks__ contains different MRSW and MRMW locks from Chapter 2.
* __Tests__ contains tests for mutual exclusion for this locks. I would also like to formalize in the form of a test the *fairness* property.
* __DiningPhilosophers__ is sandbox project for solving Dijkstra ["Dining philosophers" problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem).
* __Sandox__ used for other sandbox studies, e.g. to check and show *fairness* property.
